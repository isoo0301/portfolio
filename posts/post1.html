    <h1>How I Got Into AI Security Research</h1>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> June 29, 2025</p>

    <p>
      This summer, I joined an REU program at the University of Missouri focused on consumer networking technologies.
      My project involved using LLMs to generate vulnerable C/C++ code snippets and training a GNN for automated vulnerability detection.
    </p>

    <p>
      I designed prompts to simulate CWE-class vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and null pointer dereference, validated them with static analyzers like FlawFinder, and transformed them into code property graphs (ASTs, CFGs, PDGs).
    </p>

    <p>
      My favorite part has been building a pipeline from code generation to GNN training â€” combining software engineering, AI, and cybersecurity.
