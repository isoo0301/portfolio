    <h1>How I Got Into AI Security Research</h1>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> June 29, 2025</p>

    <p>This summer, I joined an REU program at the University of Missouri focused on consumer networking technologies. 
      My project involved using LLMs to generate vulnerable C/C++ code snippets and training a GNN for automated vulnerability 
      detection. This REU program runs for 10 weeks from May 19th to July 25th with a $7000 stipend, with meals and housing included. 
      The program was funded by the NSF for STEM majors. 
    </p>

    <p>The reason why I decided to apply to this program was because I wanted to explore how life would be as a graduate student. 
      As my dad got his PhD in the US, he used to tell me how hard it was to obtain his doctorate degree. He specifically mentioned 
      "Die or Study," as he had to go back to Korea if he couldn't pass the exams and be kicked out of the school.
    </p>

    <p>If I were more diligent, I would've applied to other universities that required separate applications for their programs. 
      However, since I was a bit lazy, I just wrote the common application on the NSF website and applied to more than 30 universities 
      that aligned with my major. While I got accepted to several universities, the reason why I came to Mizzou was because I was interested 
      in networking and it was the first place that told me that I got accepted. The program's timing was perfect since my school ended on May 17th 
      and I planned to visit Korea for the last month of my summer break.
    </p>
    
    <p>The way to get here was a bit complicated. If I were to take Uber, it would've been so easy, but since I've never used Uber 
      before and was terrified about its cost, I booked a flight ticket about 2 months ago and went to St. Louis Airport. 
      I spent way more time and money than I expected. Saturday flight was $200 more expensive than the Friday one. 
      I originally booked the Friday one expecting that the dormitory would be open at that time. 
      I didn't get informed when I'd be able to move in, so I emailed twice before but couldn't get any response from the coordinator, 
      so I decided to send an email to a professor. I didn't want to do that because the professor seemed busy and I thought the coordinator 
      was there to help me get ready. However, she didn't reply to all my emails, so I checked in with the professor. The coordinator then 
      replied within a minute after the professor CC'd the email. I felt upset that I had wasted my time waiting for her to respond.
    </p>
    
    <p>Four days before my flight, I got an email from the coordinator that she booked a hotel at St. Louis, so I should call the hotel 
      to book a hotel shuttle. But when I searched on the hotel website, they said they do not offer airport shuttle service. 
      Although it was my finals week, I decided to email her that I would need compensation for the shuttle bus since it cost $70 total. 
      She responded back that they would provide the Uber fee, so I had my smile back. Although the communication with her was not quick, 
      I was able to get whatever I needed.
    </p>
    
    <p>The flight was again inefficient since no direct flight went from Des Moines to Columbia, not St. Louis, on Saturday. 
      I was able to get there by having a layover at Dallas, Texas. After spending a night at St. Louis, I took a bus from St. Louis Airport to Columbia. 
      I had to stay at the hotel for the first four days because the university was not ready to open the dormitories. They somehow messed up the schedule, 
      so we had to spend several days at a hotel on campus.
    </p>
    
    <p>The first impression of Missouri was that it has lots of trees. Unlike Iowa where everywhere is cornfields and flat, 
      this place seemed to have some hills and trees. The two significant colors that caught my eyes were brown and green. 
      On the second day, we went to Naka Hall, and there were 5 projects we could pick and research for the summer. 
      Two people were matched to a project, and I wanted to do research on Infect Prompt where they inject vulnerability into code 
      using LLMs and train models based on the dataset generated through LLM.
