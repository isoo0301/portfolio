    <h1>How I Got Into AI Security Research</h1>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> June 29, 2025</p>

    <p>
      This summer, I joined an REU program at the University of Missouri focused on consumer networking technologies.
      My project involved using LLMs to generate vulnerable C/C++ code snippets and training a GNN for automated vulnerability detection.
      This REU program holds for 10 weeks from May 19th to July 25th with $7000 stipend with meals, housing included.
      The program was funded by the NSF for STEM majors. The reason why I decided to apply to this program was because I wanted to explore
      how life would be as a graduate student. As my dad got his phD in the US, he used to tell me how hard it was to obtain his Doctorate Degree.
      He specifically mentioned "Die or Study," as he had to go back to Korea if he couldn't pass the exams and be kicked out of the school.
      If I were more diligent, I would've applied to other universities that required separate applications for their programs. However, since I was a bit
      lazy, I just wrote the common application on NSF website and applied to more than 30 universities that aligned with my major. 
      While I got accepted to several universities, the reason why I came to Mizzou was because I was interested in Networking and it was the 
      first place that told me that I got accepted. The program's timing was perfect since my school ended on May 17th and I planned to visit Korea for the
      last month of my Summer break. The way to get here was a bit complicated. If I were to take Uber, it would've been so easy, but since I've never
      used Uber before, and was terrified about its cost, I booked a flight ticket about 2 months ago and went to Saint Louis Airport.
      I spent way more time and money than I expected. Saturday flight was 200 dollars more expensive than the Friday one. I originally booked the Friday
      one expecting that the dormitory provided opens at that time. I didn't get informed when I'd be able to move in so I emailed 2 times before but couldn't 
      get any response from the coordinator so I decided to send an email to a professor. I didn't wanted to do that because the professor seemed busy and I thought
      coordinator was there to help me get ready. However, she didn't reply to all my emails so I checked in with the professor. The coordinator, then replied within
      a minute after the professor CC the email. I felt upset that I had wasted my time before for her to respond.

      My favorite part has been building a pipeline from code generation to GNN training â€” combining software engineering, AI, and cybersecurity.
