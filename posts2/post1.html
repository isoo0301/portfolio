    <p>This summer, I joined an REU program at the University of Missouri focused on consumer networking technologies. 
 My project involved using LLMs to generate vulnerable C/C++ code snippets and training a GNN for automated vulnerability 
 detection. This REU program runs for 10 weeks from May 19th to July 25th with a $7000 stipend, with meals and housing included. 
 The program was funded by the NSF for STEM majors. 
    </p>

    <p> I decided to apply to this program because I wanted to explore what life would be like as a graduate student. 
 As my dad got his PhD in the US, he told me how hard it was to obtain his doctorate. He specifically mentioned 
 "Die or Study," as he had to return to Korea if he couldn't pass the exams and be kicked out of the school.
    </p>

    <p>If I were more diligent, I would've applied to other universities that required separate applications for their programs. 
 However, since I was a bit lazy, I wrote the Common Application on the NSF website and applied to more than 30 universities 
 aligned with my major. While I got accepted to several universities, I came to Mizzou because I was interested 
 in networking, and it was the first place that told me I got accepted. The program's timing was perfect since my school ended on May 17th 
 and I planned to visit Korea for the last month of my summer break.
    </p>
    
    <p>The way to get here was a bit complicated. If I were to take Uber, it would've been so easy, but since I've never used Uber 
 before and was terrified about its cost, I booked a flight ticket about 2 months ago and went to St. Louis Airport. 
 I spent way more time and money than I expected. The Saturday flight was $200 more expensive than the Friday one. 
 I originally booked the Friday one, expecting the dormitory to be open then. 
 I didn't know when I'd be able to move in, so I emailed twice before but couldn't get any response from the coordinator, 
 so I decided to email a professor. I didn't want to do that because the professor seemed busy, and I thought the coordinator 
 was there to help me prepare. However, she didn't reply to all my emails, so I checked in with the professor. The coordinator  
 replied within a minute after the professor CC'd the email. I felt upset that I had wasted time waiting for her to respond.
    </p>
    
    <p>Four days before my flight, I got an email from the coordinator that she had booked a hotel in St. Louis, so I should call the hotel 
 to book a shuttle. But when I searched the hotel website, they said they do not offer airport shuttle service. 
 Although it was my finals week, I emailed her that I would need compensation for the shuttle bus since it cost $70. 
 She responded that they would provide the Uber fee, so I had my smile back. Although the communication with her was not quick, 
 I was able to get whatever I needed.
    </p>
    
    <p>The flight was again inefficient since no direct flight went from Des Moines to Columbia, not St. Louis, on Saturday. 
 I got there by having a layover in Dallas, Texas. After spending a night in St. Louis, I took a bus from St. Louis Airport to Columbia. 
 I had to stay at the hotel for the first four days because the university was not ready to open the dormitories. They somehow messed up the schedule, 
 So we had to spend several days at a hotel on campus.
    </p>
    
    <p>The first impression of Missouri was that it has many trees. Unlike Iowa, where everywhere is cornfields and flat, 
 this place seemed to have some hills and trees. The two significant colors that caught my eye were brown and green. On the second day, we went to Naka Hall, and there were five projects we could pick and research for the summer. Two people were matched to a project. I wanted to research Infect Prompt, where they inject vulnerability into code using LLMs and train models based on the dataset generated through LLM.
