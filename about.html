        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm Lauren Kwon! I love running and traveling. I've explored over 14 countries so far, including New Zealand,
            Switzerland, and Japan. My passion for discovering new cultures started early, when my family and I took a month-long road
            trip from California to NewYork. I was only ten years old., but I still remeber every moment vividly.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm the type of person who dives deep into what I love-whether that's learning a new language,
            pursuing personal growth, or getting lost in a great film or drama. I'm also a bit of a perfectionist,
            always striving to give my best in everything I do.
        </p>
